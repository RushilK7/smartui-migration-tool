Set the following environment variables in your CI/CD provider's settings:

- `PROJECT_TOKEN` - Your SmartUI project token
- `LT_USERNAME` - Your LambdaTest username  
- `LT_ACCESS_KEY` - Your LambdaTest access key

**Note:** These secrets have been added as placeholders in your CI/CD configuration files. Make sure to replace them with your actual credentials.

npx smartui exec -- mvn test
```

### 📝 Additional Notes

**E2E Testing:** Your end-to-end tests have been migrated to use SmartUI's web testing capabilities. The tool will capture screenshots during test execution and compare them against your baseline images.
