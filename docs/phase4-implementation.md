- **Supported Frameworks**: React, Angular, Vue, Cypress, Playwright
- **Features**:
  - Pattern recognition for framework-specific code
  - Convention analysis and validation
  - Best practices detection
  - Anti-pattern identification
  - Framework-specific transformations

### 3. Platform-Specific Transformer (`PlatformSpecificTransformer.ts`)
